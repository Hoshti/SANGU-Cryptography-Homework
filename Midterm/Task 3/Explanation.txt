    What Happened:

        The HMAC changed completely when we modified just one character (v â†’ V)

        This demonstrates the avalanche effect of cryptographic hash functions

    Why HMAC is Important:

        Authentication: Verifies the message came from someone with the secret key

        Integrity: Any modification of the data (even 1 bit) changes the HMAC completely

        Security: Without the secret key, attackers can't forge valid HMACs

        Tamper Detection: Used to verify data hasn't been altered in transit/storage

    Practical Applications:

        API authentication

        Message verification in protocols

        File integrity checks

        Secure cookie generation

The HMAC provides both authenticity and integrity checking in one operation, making it superior to simple hashing when you need to verify the source of the data.
