Where is Diffie-Hellman Used?

    TLS Handshake (HTTPS, VPNs, SSH)

        Used in Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve DH (ECDHE) to establish a secure session key.

        Prevents retrospective decryption (even if the serverâ€™s private key is later compromised, past sessions remain secure).

    Secure Messaging (Signal Protocol, WhatsApp, OTR)

        Ensures forward secrecy, meaning each session has a unique key.

        Protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks when combined with authentication.

    IPSec (VPN Encryption)

        Used in IKE (Internet Key Exchange) to securely negotiate encryption keys.

Why is DH Important for Secure Communication?

    No Need to Pre-Share Keys: Unlike symmetric encryption, DH allows two parties to generate a shared secret without ever transmitting it.

    Forward Secrecy: Temporary session keys prevent mass decryption if a long-term key is compromised.

    Resistant to Eavesdropping: Even if an attacker intercepts public keys, they cannot compute the shared secret without a private key.

Conclusion

Diffie-Hellman enables secure key exchange in modern encryption protocols, ensuring confidentiality and integrity in internet communications. Its variants (ECDHE) are widely used in TLS, messaging apps, and VPNs.
