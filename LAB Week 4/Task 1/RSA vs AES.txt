RSA vs AES Comparison

RSA (Asymmetric):
- Uses public/private key pair
- Slower for encrypting large amounts of data
- Typically used for encrypting small data like symmetric keys
- Key sizes are larger (2048-bit or more for security)
- Encryption/decryption requires more computational power
- Ideal for key exchange and digital signatures

AES (Symmetric):
- Uses a single shared key
- Much faster for encrypting large amounts of data
- Used for bulk data encryption
- Key sizes are smaller (128/192/256-bit)
- Less computationally intensive
- Requires secure key exchange mechanism

Use Cases:
- RSA is best for securely exchanging keys or small data
- AES is best for encrypting large files or data streams
- Common practice: Use RSA to encrypt an AES key, then use AES to encrypt the actual data
